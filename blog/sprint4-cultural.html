      <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          The principles of neuroplasticity are essentially the science behind what is called growth mindset. Neuroplasticity can be described as the ability of the brain to restructure itself and grow. Just like a muscle, the brain can get stronger the more you use it. 
          <br><br>
          When the neurons in your brain fire in a particular way they make connections and pathways within your brain. The more that this connection is used the stronger it becomes, and it will get both easier and faster for the brain to use the pathway. This makes practice and repetition some of the best ways to increase neuroplasticity.
          <br><br>
          When people understand neuroplasticity, their perception of their own abilities can also change and can understand that their intelligence and abilities are not actually fixed traits. This shift perception is towards what is called a Growth Mindset. This shift in mindset can also make it easier for people to embrace mistakes, obstacles, and challenges, as these are all important aspects of the learning process.
