          So far my goal is to successfully complete this course, and then gain employment as a junior developer to further hone my skills. Other than that, I can't say that I have a firm career pathway in mind, as I feel that I do not yet know enough about the industry to decide on this yet. I think that one day I would like to take my skills and work somewhere overseas. Another thing I would like to consider as a goal would be the ability to work flexibly and remotely. I do know that some companies would offer these types of working conditions, or this could also be achieved by working for myself.

          I really enjoy problem solving and developing ideas. Anytime I am faced with a problem, I turn it over in my head to solve it before I take action. With regards to my limitations, something that I struggle with is putting my thoughts into words, especially when I am put on the spot and asked to express my ideas. This can sometimes mean that I miss the opportunity to share my thoughts.

          While at EDA, I would like to develop stronger communication skills. More specifically, I would like to become more confident and articulate when communicating my thoughts and ideas with others.

          My strengths should especially help when it comes to problem solving. When I come across a problem in my learning journey, I will spend time to turn it over in my head to come up with a solution. It can sometimes be uncomfortable to not know what to do, but I will remind myself that discomfort is a good indication that you are about to learn something new.

          When I am faced with a problem that I am unable to solve on my own, I am committed to consulting with my cohort, and if necessary also with a facilitator. Although I am very much inclined to try and solve a problem on my own, I understand that sometimes it can be a more efficient and effective learning approach to ask for help from others. From the facilitation team, it would be very valuable for a relationship to be established where as a student I feel comfortable to ask for support whenever it might be needed, and to also receive constructive feedback when necessary.

          During September I will be away in Japan for 2 weeks on holiday. This time away will be for the entirety of Sprint 4 of Foundations. My plan is to get as far through Sprint 4 as I can before I leave, and to continue working on it as much as I can while away. When I return from my holiday, ideally I would have finished Sprint 4 and be starting on Sprint 5. Should this not go to plan, I have an entire week free from work and any other commitments right before Bootcamp begins and can use this time to catch up.
