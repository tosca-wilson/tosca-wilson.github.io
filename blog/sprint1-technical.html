      <h3>Padding</h3>
        <p>
          The <em>padding</em> is the space that is between the element’s content and the element’s border.
        </p>
      <h3>Border</h3>
        <p>
          The <em>border</em> represents the edge of an element and it sits between the padding and margin. The border encompasses both the padding and the content. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Even if a border has not been defined in terms of color, width and style, it will still exist as a boundary line between the padding and margin.
        </p>
      <h3>Margin</h3>
        <p>
          The <em>margin</em> is the space that is between the outside of the element’s border and next element.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          The best way to understand the difference between margin and padding is through an image. The image below demonstrates what each part defined above looks like in relation to an element.

          Although padding and margins are similar in that they both refer to space around an element, they are used to different purposes, and you would adjust them differently according to what you are trying to achieve. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Padding for example, can be thought of not just as spacing, but as an extension of the element itself. It can be hard to see this with a total white fill background. If you set an element's background color to green the padding of the element will take on this colour also, with the background colour stopping at the border.
