            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
                <p>
                Two of my primary values in life are family and adventure. My time family is hugely important to me. In terms of adventure, I specifically love to travel. I have lived overseas a couple of times, and get a real thrill out of the change and the challenge of it. 
                My boyfriend and I had been planning for almost a year to relocate overseas to do a working holiday in the UK, and had planned to leave at the beginning of winter this year. Just as our plans for the move had begun to firm up, some unexpected news came up and I found out that a close family member of mine was unwell. This of course created a big conflict in two of my values - adventure and family. 
                It was pretty hard for us to let go of our travel plans that we had been anticipating for so long, but after weighing it all up we decided it would not be worth leaving incase the relatives treatment did not go well while we were away. 
                As it turned out, we have been able to provide a lot of support to our family, the family member is currently doing really well, and we definitely do not regret our decision to stay. Although I was unable to travel, I have been adventurous in other aspects of my life, such as pursuing a career change in web development.

            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
                <p>
                I have grown up with strong connections to both my immediate and extended family, and it is because of this that I have had strong family values instilled in me. 
                My dad immigrated from the United States to New Zealand. Both of my parents have done a great number of amazing things both in New Zealand and around the world. Their desire for adventure has been passed on to me directly. 
                During my childhood, we moved around a lot, so uprooting from the known became the norm, as did learning to adapt quickly and experiencing the wonder of new environments. Living in a variety of places in my life taught me acceptance of people's differences and about inclusivity. Through these experiences, the values of change, growth and openness were impressed upon me and they remain important to me today.

            <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
                <p>
                Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
                At my current workplace, everyone does the Gallup Strengthâ€™s test. This is a really great tool that allows us all have an awareness of how everyone works, and therefore how to get the best out of them. The results of the Gallup test seemed to really get it right, not just for me but also others that I work with. Prior to doing this test, although I had a self awareness of the way that I work, I had never considered these characteristics of mine to be my strengths. 
                According to these results, my top strength was intellection. This has nothing to do with intelligence, but to a love or thinking. For me, there is constant mental hum of activity, and this can be focused or unfocused and is actually very difficult to switch off. I really enjoy problem solving and developing ideas, and I thrive off having quiet time alone for mulling things over. Anytime I am faced with a problem, I turn it over in my head to solve it before I take action. 
                Another strength that came out was deliberation. This strength can be described as being very deliberate about making the next move. I like to carefully plan ahead to anticipate possible scenarios, and I am always considering the consequences my actions may have in the future. Although this makes me very risk aware, it does not necessarily make me risk averse. 
                The final strength that I would like to discuss is that of learning. When it comes to learning, what I really enjoy is the process and progress more so than the end result. In my personal life, I generally find it pretty easy to find things that interest me and that I would like to learn or work on. In terms of professional life, I am really looking for a career that allows for constant change and growth, and this part of the big attraction that web development has for me. 
                With regards to my limitations, something that I can struggle with is putting my thoughts into words, especially when I am not expecting it and I am put on the spot and asked to express my ideas. Often is not until after a conversation, when I have had a moment to think something through that I have figured out what I would really like to share. This can sometimes mean that I have missed the opportunity to share my thoughts.  
                </p>
            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
                <p>
                I think that all the strengths discussed above will be helpful in my learning journey. My strengths should especially help when it comes to problem solving. When I come across a problem in my learning journey, I suspect I will spend time to turn it over in my head to come up with a solution. I will also take time to consider different potential outcomes before putting a solution into action. Finally, I will often be enjoying the process outlined above. Even if it is uncomfortable to not know what to do sometimes, it is a good indication that you are about to learn something new.
