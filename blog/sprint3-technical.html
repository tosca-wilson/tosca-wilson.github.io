      <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
          If I was making a cake out of HTML and CSS, the basic key ingredients like flour, sugar, butter, milk, eggs and baking powder would be the HTML. On their own, they would create the structure of a cake, although it would be very bland. To make the cake more delicious and also more beautiful, I would use CSS to select and apply the colour and flavour of the icing and any other decoration on top of the cake.  
        </p>
      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
        <p>
            The control flow is the order in which the computer executes the code. By default, code will be executed from top to bottom, unless told otherwise. Loops allow a block of code to be repeatedly executed until a certain condition is met. Once the condition is met, the next part of the code can be executed. 
            <br>
            <br>
            To continue the cake analogy, the control flow would describe leaving the cake to bake in an oven preheated to 180 degrees, while the loop would determine that the cake be left baking in the oven until stop condition is met, which in this analogy would be the completion of the oven timer of 45 minutes. Now that the stop condition has been met the control flow can move to the next piece of code, which would detail removing the cake from the oven.
        </p>
      <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h3>
        <p>
            The DOM Stands for document object model. The DOM represents the HTML of a page and is presented in a tree structure as seen in the below image.
        </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            The Document Object is an interface that allows access to and modification of the document content, meaning that you can use it to change the page's structure, style and content.
    
            Javascript can be used to interact with the DOM. Using JS, you can specify which specific property of the HTML you would like to access, and change it accordingly.
            <br><br>
            To return elements based on whatever Id we passed we would use; <em> document.getElementById()</em>
            <br><br>
            To return elements based on whatever classname we passed, we would use; <em> document.getElementByClassName() </em>
            </p>
          <br>
        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
        <p>
            Data from an array is accessed using the index. An array is a list of values between square brackets with each value separated by a comma. The first index of an array is zero, rather than one. The notation for accessing the data inside an array also uses square brackets. 
            For example; <em>nameOfArray[0]</em> 
            <br><br>
            Data from an object can be accessed using dot notation or using square brackets. Accessing an object using square brackets is useful when a property name has a space or a hyphen, or starts with a number.
            
            <br><br>
            To access data using dot notation; <em>objectName.propertyName</em><br><br>
            To access using square brackets; <em>objectName['Property Name']</em>
            <br>
        </p>
          <br>
        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, a function can be defined as a block of code that will perform a particular task. This function will then be executed when it is invoked in JavaScript, or called. This is useful because it means that the function is repeatable and can be performed as much as desired, without having to be written out and repeated within the code multiple times.
