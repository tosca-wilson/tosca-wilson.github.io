      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is being aware of and understanding your own feelings and how they affect yourself and others around you. By understanding how you and others are feeling, you can express yourself better and communicate more effectively.

      <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>
            IQ is short for intelligence quotient and measures someones cognitive abilities and logic. EQ is the measure of someones ability to understand and manage the emotions of themselves and others.
        </p>
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>
            As Emotional Intelligence is the ability to identify and express one's own emotions and thoughts, and to also rightly interpret those of other people, EQ is essential for communication and relationship development. According to research, people with high EQ have better mental health, job performance, and general quality of life.
